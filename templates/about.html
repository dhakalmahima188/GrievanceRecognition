            <h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <article>
                <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
                <p>Grievance recognition refers to the ability to identify and acknowledge the concerns, complaints, or
                    grievances of individuals or groups with an organization. It is an important aspect
                    of effective communication, conflict resolution, and relations. In Nepal, as in many other
                    countries, the effective recognition and resolution of grievances play a pivotal role in ensuring
                    harmonious relationships within various contexts, such as workplaces, public services, and
                    social interactions. Thousands of complaints are registered in the municipality, VDC and
                    other complaint concerned offices,faxed, emailed, tweeted,posted, etc and they are found to
                    be not properly followed up, resolved or acted upon.However, the existing grievance recognition
                    process in Nepal often involves multiple layers of bureaucracy and authorities, resulting
                    in a lengthy and convoluted complaint registration process. This has led to concerns about
                    the proper follow-up and resolution of grievances, thereby affecting the trust of citizens in
                    the system. In this context, it is crucial to analyze the challenges posed by the current
                    grievance recognition process in Nepal and explore potential solutions for a more efficient
                    and responsive system.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The current complaint registration system in Nepal lacks efficiency and effectiveness. They
                    are predominantly characterized by outdated reliance on paper-based procedures and hence
                    offer a long process to be solved with chains of ministry and offices in the contact queue. Users
                    often face challenges in filing complaints, leading to delays in resolution and frustration. The
                    existing process heavily relies on manual intervention, resulting in errors, inconsistencies,
                    and a time-consuming experience for both users and staff.As a result, grievances may go
                    unnoticed or unaddressed until they escalate into more serious problems, causing disruptions
                    and dissatisfaction among citizens.
                    The grievance recognition system using text/speech aims to enhance the user experience,
                    improve complaint management, and expedite complaint resolution .This project aims to
                    develop an automated Grievance Recognition System that leverages advanced technologies,to
                    identify, categorize, and prioritize public grievances in real-time.</p>
         
         
                <h3>1.3 Objectives</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li> To create an AI-based system that can intelligently understand and process user complaints
                        given through voice/text.</li>
                    <li>To automate the filing of complaints, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
                    <li> To incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze and categorize complaints based on their
                        nature, severity, and urgency. The system will analyze various data sources,
                        including text-based communication, survey responses, and social media interactions,
                        to detect signs of potential grievances and flag them for appropriate action.</li>
                    <li>To offer comprehensive complaint management capabilities, allowing staff to track,
                        monitor, and update complaint status .</li>
                    <li>To generate insightful reports and analytic based on complaint data, highlighting
                        trends, patterns, and areas for improvement To work as a team and seek a solution to
                        a real world problem.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> 2.1.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>For fine-tuning the wav2vec2 model for Nepali language, we used the OpenSLR dataset
                    “Large Nepali ASR training data set” consisting of about 157,000 utterances. The audios
                    were converted to .flac format, as it is a lossless-compressed format. Some of the audios
                    were of varying durations and invalid labels, so we filtered the data. The labeled transcripts
                    for the audio were cleaned before using them for fine-tuning the wav2vec2 model. For finetuning the
                    wav2vec2 model, the dataset was partitioned into smaller datasets based on the
                    duration, as it was computationally infeasible to train the model on the entire dataset at
                    once. So, partitions of approximately 5000 files were created and models were trained on
                    these partitions using checkpointing. The model was fine-tuned for each dataset partition
                    and then the best model for each partition was saved, so the fine-tuning of the next dataset
                    partition was based on the previous best model.
                    For further refining the performance of the model, we collected audio data from the call
                    center of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City. The audio data from two-way communication
                    between call center officials and the general public along with the ringtone that needs to be
                    trimmed and parsed.


                </p>
                <h3> 2.1.2 Feature Extraction</h3>
                <p>
                    For fine-tuning the wav2vec2 model on our own Nepali dataset, features were extracted
                    by using the Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor which is part of the Hugging Face Transformers
                    library, and it extracts features from the data using self-supervised learning. Before feature
                    extraction from the audio data, tokenization was performed usingWav2Vec2CTCTokenizer
                    which took the vocabulary and added tokens for unknown, padding, and word delimiter.
                    Then the features were extracted using Wav2vec2FeatureExtractor. For feature extraction,
                    parameters like feature size of 1, a sampling rate of 16000, and a padding value of 0 were used,
                    features were then normalized, and returned the attention mask from the feature extractor.
                    Also, Wav2vec2 uses a feature encoder for feature extraction. Then a processor was created
                    using the Wav2vec2 Processor which took the feature extractor and tokenizer as arguments.
                    This processor was saved, which was later used for testing.</p>

                <h3> 2.1.3 Model Design and Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    The performance of pre-trained models that were using RNN-based networks (like LSTM)
                    were poor and thus inappropriate for our case because of low accuracy (i.e. high WER). So,
                    we decided to use the transformer based wav2vec2 model which has excellent performance.
